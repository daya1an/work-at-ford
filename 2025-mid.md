Over the last six months, I've been actively involved in enhancing and maintaining various GCAT modules, alongside significant contributions to our DevSecOps practices and broader infrastructure initiatives. My work has focused on delivering new features, resolving critical issues, and improving system efficiency and security.

Here's a Summary of my key contributions and accomplishments:

### 1. GCAT -  Workqueue Module:
- Implemented "LRA" reason code logic, delivering a complete solution rapidly and with minimal code change in the main post-launch phase.

### 2. GCAT -  Part Info Module:
- Identified and resolved an important functionality called "Service Part Deletion" with full security compliance.

### 3. GCAT -  WBS Module:
- Revamped the "Show Properties" module and introduced significant new functionalities, including section deletion, filtering powertrain sections, and MQ message generation.
- Resolved the majority of reported issues in the Catalog Section screen and addressed all complex MQ scenarios within the module.

### 4. GCAT -  Usage Module:
- Resolved "Suppress" and "Unsuppress" GCAT usage issues and thoroughly fixed and tested all associated MQ scenarios.

### 5. GCAT -  Illustration Module:
- Implemented missing functionalities in the B2B workqueue screen.
- Built the UDI tool from scratch for the Manual Upload module, encompassing GCS bucket creation, correcting existing CORS configurations, and so on.

### 6. GCAT -  Master Module:
- Revamped the entire "Section Prefix Management" flow, resolving all corresponding MQ scenarios.
- Addressed major issues within the "Job #1 Timing Change" screen.

### 7. GCAT -  DevSecOps Activities:
-  Migrated the Angular project's managed Tekton pipeline from Nexus Artifactory-based setup to a JFrog Artifactory-based one.
-  Resolved all high-potential Checkmarx security issues in the Angular project, which was very crucial for enabling the application to go live.
-  Identified root causes and fixed issues related to Tekton and Ecoboost updates, ensuring stability in the build and deployment process.
-  Assisted the team with NGINX configuration and fixing dark API related issues for the Angular project, ensuring alignment with Cloud Armor policies and the successful establishment of a legitimate, approved vanity URL.
-  Conducted a thorough analysis of Terraform configurations, identifying potential issues and their root causes. This analysis was instrumental in helping the team restructure incorrect configurations, resulting in improved infrastructure stability and was very beneficial for future GCP-related activities.
-  Contributed significantly to the Apigee 2.0 migration for the Masters, Manual Upload, and Part Information modules.

### 8. SBOM and SPBOM:
-   Worked in SBOM and SPBOM applications for Apigee 2.0 Migration.
-   Assisted with critical fixes for Managed Tekton pipelines.
