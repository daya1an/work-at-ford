# What work was done: 

1. GBPS:
- PCF to GCP CAAS Migration
2. PCII JAVA:
- Security Audit Compliance and Tech Upgrades
3. GSPPS:
- PRC service: API level Security Audit Compliance and Tech Upgrades
- Microservices: Security Audit Compliance and Tech Upgrades
- GSPPS-legacy: Ant to Gradle Workspace Migraion, JFROG Migration and PCF to On prem CAAS migration Support

# How was done:

* In PCII-Java Applications, successfully identified all the security vulnerabilities identified by FOSSA, SonarQube, and Checkmarx static analysis tools. Along with that, executed necessary technical upgrades, paving the way for a seamless migration from PCF to GCP.

* In the GSPPS PRC-service Application, implemented robust API security measures, achieving compliance with FOSSA, SonarQube, and Checkmarx static analysis, as well as 42Crunch API security testing. Published the API to Apigee, enhancing security and management capabilities and successfully deployed to production.

* In GSPPS Microservices, completed Security Audit Compliance using FOSSA, Sonarqube, and Checkmarx and performed all the necessary Technical Upgrades required for GCP movement. Finally, deployed and tested the microservices in Production(PCF). 

* Took an Initiative in analyzing, planning, and completing pre-migration requirements for moving our WebSphere Liberty applications from PCF to both Openshift GCP-CAAS and on-premise CAAS platforms. 

* In the GSPPS Legacy Application, migrated the application from the ANT build system to Gradle workspace and transitioned the codebase to JFrog Artifactory. Supported in PCF to Openshift On-prem CAAS migration

* In the GBPS Application, successfully identified and resolved a critical SQL connectivity issue. Migrated the codebase to JFrog Artifactory and successfully deployed the application to the Openshift GCP-CAAS DEV environment.
